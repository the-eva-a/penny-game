# Welcome to the Petting Zoo
_A playground for code_

## Why a petting zoo
In real life, petting zoos let us play with and learn about eclectic collections of animals. This space is a home for what will become quite an eclectic collection of small pet projects. 
Projects here may have a niche motivation and are more to help me get into the practice of coding and learning than creating anything impressive. Even so, they have a special place in my heart and I am glad to showcase them here.

## Projects
### The Penny Game 
This project is based on a real-life game I play with my grandmother every Thanksgiving. You can see a [webarchived link](/web/20231027181543/https://www.creativecrafthouse.com/penny-drop-premium-version-fun-family-or-bar-game.html) to see what the real-life game looks like. This project is designed to be a simple recreation with text input and output. Currently, I have a partially working model, I just need to organize the files and upload them.
